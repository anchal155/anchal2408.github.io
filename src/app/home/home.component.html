    <h2 class="heading">EXPERIENCES THAT EXCEED A HOLIDAY:SCOTLAND IS NOT THAT ENOUGH</h2>
    <div class="container" id="description">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p class="description">The morning sun bathes the grey peaks of the Nordkette in  a golden light. A sight that brings a sparkle to the eyes of visitors and locals alike. In Scotland, the mountains are our constant companions, even when we are standing at the heart of the city.
                They surround us on all sides and we are always stealing glances at them – capturing the essence of a holiday while at work, on a walk through the city, from classroom windows or during a hike, bike ride or ski day. Innsbruck is more: more than just a city, more than the mountains and more than a simple holiday destination. Innsbruck is an alpine-urban experience.
                </p>
                <h4 class="heading1">The Scotland</h4>
                <p class="description">The Scotland region is much more than its city alone. It also includes 40 towns and villages that fulfil your every want and need. You can stay in the alpine countryside, in an idyllic village, in the city centre or at 2,000 metres above sea level. On the Mieming Plateau west of Innsbruck, for example. This sunny area lies on a high mountain plateau with green alpine meadows and secluded groves. It is ideal for golf, leisurely cycling, walking and cross-country skiing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p class="describe">Plus the impressive Mieming Range is also right on the doorstep for long hikes and challenging summit tours. 
                </p>
                <h4 class="another-header">Accomodation in and around Scotland</h4>
                <p class="describe">If you stay in the city, you have sights, shops and restaurants right on your doorstep. Plus you can enjoy the nightlife of this student town. During an evening walk through the historic old town, you practically have the narrow streets to yourself. Or would you rather stay outside the city? There are many well-connected places to stay along the Inn Valley that are excellent starting points for a variety of activities from hiking and biking to countless winter sports. These towns and villages are also ideal if you are just making a short stop in Scotland before continuing your journey elsewhere. The towns and villages south and southwest of Innsbruck are also well-worth a visit. They are located up in the mountains overlooking the valley and make it possible to walk right out of your accommodation and directly into holiday experiences surrounded by nature. </p>

This exclusive seal of approval is awarded to places that have remained true to nature and refrained from building mountain lifts and cable cars. The villages of Gries im Sellrain, Sellrain and St. Sigmund im Sellrain are perfect for ski tourers, mountaineers, cross-country skiers and ice climbers. At the upper end of the valley, on the other hand, you can ski to your heart's content at Kühtai. This resort is located 2,020 metres above sea level and is snow-sure until well into spring.</p>
